# 0x03. Responsive Design

## 📋 Project Description

This project focuses on mastering the principles of **Responsive Web Design (RWD)** using HTML and CSS. It aims to teach how to create web layouts that adapt smoothly across various screen sizes and devices, ensuring an optimal user experience regardless of resolution or orientation.

We explore essential techniques including **mobile-first design**, **media queries**, **fluid layouts**, **flexible images**, and modern CSS layout systems like **Flexbox** and **CSS Grid**.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, I will be able to explain and implement the following concepts without external resources:

- ✅ The philosophy of **mobile-first design**
- ✅ How and when to use **media queries**
- ✅ Recommended **sizes and breakpoints** for responsive design
- ✅ Strategies to **make a website responsive**
- ✅ The difference between **responsive** and **adaptive** design
- ✅ Usage of **CSS units** for flexible layouts: `em`, `rem`, `%`, `vw`, `vh`, etc.
