This project covers the **fundamentals of HTML5** — the building blocks of the web. You will learn how to:

- Structure a webpage using semantic elements.
- Differentiate between inline and block-level elements.
- Embed various types of content (images, videos, audio, tables, etc.).
- Ensure accessibility and maintainability through proper HTML markup.

⚠️ *Note: No CSS or JavaScript will be used. The goal is to focus solely on HTML structure and semantics.*
